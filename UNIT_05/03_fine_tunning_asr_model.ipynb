    "In this section, we‚Äôll cover a step-by-step guide on fine-tuning Whisper for speech recognition on the Common Voice 13 dataset. We‚Äôll use the ‚Äòsmall‚Äô version of the model and a relatively lightweight dataset, enabling you to run fine-tuning fairly quickly on any 16GB+ GPU with low disk space requirements, such as the 16GB T4 GPU provided in the Google Colab free tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you have a smaller GPU or encounter memory issues during training, you can follow the suggestions provided for reducing memory usage. Conversely, should you have access to a larger GPU, you can amend the training arguments to maximise your throughput. Thus, this guide is accessible regardless of your GPU specifications!\n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, this guide outlines how to fine-tune the Whisper model for the Dhivehi language. However, the steps covered here generalise to any language in the Common Voice dataset, and more generally to any ASR dataset on the Hugging Face Hub. You can tweak the code to quickly switch to a language of your choice and fine-tune a Whisper model in your native tongue üåç\n",

    "In this section, we covered a step-by-step guide on fine-tuning the Whisper model for speech recognition ü§ó Datasets, Transformers and the Hugging Face Hub. We first loaded the Dhivehi subset of the Common Voice 13 dataset and pre-processed it by computing log-mel spectrograms and tokenising the text. We then defined a data collator, evaluation metric and training arguments, before using the ü§ó Trainer to train and evaluate our model. We finished by uploading the fine-tuned model to the Hugging Face Hub, and showcased how to share and use it with the pipeline() class.\n",

    "If you followed through to this point, you should now have a fine-tuned checkpoint for speech recognition, well done! ü•≥ Even more importantly, you‚Äôre equipped with all the tools you need to fine-tune the Whisper model on any speech recognition dataset or domain. So what are you waiting for! Pick one of the datasets covered in the section Choosing a Dataset or select a dataset of your own, and see whether you can get state-of-the-art performance! The leaderboard is waiting for you‚Ä¶"
